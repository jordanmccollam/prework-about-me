      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hello! I'm Jordan! I'm a musician, newly married, and my favorite color is blue. I'm here because I'm looking to start a stable career that can support my new family.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I'm from a little town in California called Vacaville. It's one of those towns where nothing happens so, of course, I moved to Nashville, TN.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love music. I play a few instruments and like to mix other people's music as a side job.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Honestly! After some researching I'd have to say coding is my dream job! I love the potential of high pay, work from home, and working on computers. I'm willing to work my way up to that though.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I'm currently living in Goodlettsville, TN. It's a decent spot! I'm no more than 20 minutes away from anything I could possibly be interested in so it's convenient.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>After a lot of researching, as I already mentioned, I thought that I had potential to be great at this. I am an excellent problem solver and love computers. It sure doesn't hurt that the average sallary is more than enough to support my family.</p>
